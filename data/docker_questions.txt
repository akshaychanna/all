Q14: Explain basic Docker usage workflow
Topic: Docker
Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐
Answer:

Everything starts with the Dockerfile. The Dockerfile is the source code of the Image.
Once the Dockerfile is created, you build it to create the image of the container. The image is just the "compiled version" of the "source code" which is the Dockerfile.
Once you have the image of the container, you should redistribute it using the registry. The registry is like a git repository -- you can push and pull images.
Next, you can use the image to run containers. A running container is very similar, in many aspects, to a virtual machine (but without the hypervisor).


Q15: What is the difference between Docker Image and Layer?
Topic: Docker
Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐
Answer:

Image: A Docker image is built up from a series of read-only layers
Layer: Each layer represents an instruction in the image’s Dockerfile.
The below Dockerfile contains four commands, each of which creates a layer.

FROM ubuntu:15.04
COPY . /app
RUN make /app
CMD python /app/app.py

Importantly, each layer is only a set of differences from the layer before it.
